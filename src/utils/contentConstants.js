			"The earliest art form in Africa is Rock Art. African art revolves around 5 basic elements, that represent different works of arts from different regions of Africa. It carries the essence of Africa that helps you understand more about the African culture, their traditions, beliefs and morals through captivating designs. African Art dates back to 500 B.C and the earliest forms belonging to Nigeria. African art has been ruthlessly disintegrated with time and taken as primitive by the Western world. But now, it is now one of the most aesthetic artefacts of the world.",

			"African art is known for its visual combination of culture, aesthetics and innovation. The ancient art has left a dent on the artists right now who inculcate the creativity and essence of the past to their visuals today. The primacy of sculpture and visual abstraction, the intricate combination of a balanced composition, the multiplicity of visuals assembled by the artists right now is breathtaking. Not just African paintings, but their sculptures, music and dance all represent their rich culture which never fails to impress the beholder.",
